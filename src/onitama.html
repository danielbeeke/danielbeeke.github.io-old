            <p class="highlighted-paragraph">Onitama, a small but interesting game. It is a really nice board game, relatively new. It looks a bit like chess but the moves are determined by cards that have sets on them.</p>
            <p>This is the first game I programmed. I learned about <a target="_blank" data-mouse-class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">finite state machines</a> and made this game in ES6, the new version of javascript.</p>

            My digital clone starts with a screen where you enter a room name so you can join a game. After choosing one, you can click on the link, share it with your friend and play the game. <br><br>Technically the user is connecting to websockets with the room name. When there are two players in a websocket's room the Nodejs server will connect them to each other via WebRTC. After that the websockets server is disconnected from the players.

            While creating this game I learned a lot about state changes, ES6 and how game development is different from plain application building.
